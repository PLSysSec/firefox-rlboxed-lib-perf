# Description

Test to measure performance of Graphite fonts in Firefox. This test measures the
performance of libgraphite. This benchmark measures the page load time when
reflowing text in a Graphite font ten times, adjusting the font size each time,
so that font caches arenâ€™t used. The test page is the "Universal Declaration of
Human Rights" adapted slightly for use as a test case.
